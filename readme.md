## Why?
This project was created for my University of Sydney INFO5060 coursework.

I used external data from South Australia to demonstrate my full skill set in data-related programming.


## Main Structure
I don’t say things that don’t matter.
This project has two main parts:

### 1. Coding
• Data Processing
Extracted and cleaned data for analysis.

• CSV File Aggregation
This script automates three main tasks:

Scans a directory to list all CSV files.

Extracts metadata from each file, including field names and total number of fields.

Reads and merges multiple CSVs into a single DataFrame for further analysis.

Finally, it exports the combined data to a new CSV file for downstream use.

• Machine Learning
Built models to uncover insights and make predictions.

### 2. Visualization (Tableau)
Used Tableau to show what people actually care about—clear, actionable insights.
